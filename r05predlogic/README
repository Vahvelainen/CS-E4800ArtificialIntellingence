==== Truth-values of formulas in the First-Order Predicate Logic ====

See STRUCT-EXAMPLE for an example of how structures are specified
in our notation, and see FORMULAS-EXAMPLE for examples of how
predicate logic formulas are written in our notation.
To evaluate all formulas in a file w.r.t. a given structure, try

  python3 predeval.py STRUCT-EXAMPLE FORMULAS-EXAMPLE

Please also read all the code.

  predlogic.py   Structures, formulas, and truth-values of formulas
  stparse.py     Read a file that contains one structure
  prparse.py     Read a file that contains formulas
  predeval.py    Main program for evaluating formulas in a given structure

cd r05predlogic
